# Go Kids — Master Project Plan
**Platform:** Future Readiness Platform for Kids
**Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) · Tailwind CSS · ShadCN UI · MongoDB Atlas · Node.js (API Routes)
**Timeline:** 12 Weeks (3 Months)
**Last Updated:** May 2026

---

## Project Overview

Go Kids is being transformed from a static informational website into a **product-led platform** with four core verticals: Assessments, Workshops, Mentor, and Talk. The platform serves three user types — Parents (end users), Instructors/Mentors (content creators), and Admins/SuperAdmins (platform operators). The system must be mobile-first, SEO-optimized, bright, visually exciting for children, and built for scale with a phased feature rollout (free → paid).

---

## Brand Identity & Design System

### Logo
The Go Kids logo (`/public/images/logo/thumbnail.png`) is bold, chunky, yellow-and-black with a comic/playful style. It must be used:
- In the Navbar (left side, ~120px wide)
- In the Footer
- On the PDF report header
- As the favicon (use a cropped square version)
- As the OG image base

**Never alter the logo colours or add filters to it.**

### Colour Palette (FIXED — applies to the entire website, all pages, all dashboards)

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` | `#F5C518` | Primary buttons, highlights, active nav, badges, CTA backgrounds |
| `primary-dark` | `#D4A900` | Button hover states, pressed states |
| `black` | `#1A1A1A` | Headlines, logo outlines, body text |
| `teal` | `#2BBCB0` | Secondary accent, cards, icon backgrounds, How It Works steps |
| `coral` | `#F4845F` | Tertiary accent, tag badges, notification dots, warm highlights |
| `sky` | `#4FC3F7` | Info states, age group cards, light backgrounds |
| `white` | `#FFFFFF` | Page backgrounds, card surfaces |
| `off-white` | `#FAFAF8` | Section backgrounds alternating with white |
| `grey-light` | `#F3F4F6` | Input backgrounds, dividers |
| `grey-text` | `#6B7280` | Subheadings, captions, placeholder text |

**No dark mode. No dark backgrounds on any page. The entire site is light, bright, and energetic.**

### Typography
- **Headlines:** `Nunito` (Google Font) — rounded, friendly, bold (700/800 weight)
- **Body:** `Inter` — clean, readable
- Both loaded via `next/font/google`

### Public Image Assets
All images are in `/public/images/` and must be used as specified:

| File | Usage |
|---|---|
| `thumbnail.png` | Logo — Navbar, Footer, PDF header, favicon |
| `hero.jpg` | Hero section background / right-side image (children drawing together, warm classroom light) |
| `programs-1.jpg` | Ages 8–12 "Young Achievers" program card (boy building robot — STEM focus) |
| `programs-2.jpg` | Ages 13–16 "Future Leaders" program card (girl with structured geometry — analytical) |
| `programs-3.jpg` | Ages 4–7 — fallback or a different section as appropriate (Indian girl with book, cheerful) |
| `workshops-banner.jpg` | Workshops section banner / Workshops listing page hero (kids drawing at table, teal classroom) |

All images must be used with `next/image` component (never `<img>`). Use `priority` prop on hero image. Add descriptive `alt` text to all images.

### Animation Guidelines (IMPORTANT — applies to entire website)
The site must feel alive and exciting for children. Use these animation patterns **consistently across all pages**:

**Entry Animations (use Framer Motion or CSS `@keyframes`):**
- Every section fades up on scroll into view (`opacity: 0, y: 20` → `opacity: 1, y: 0`, duration 0.5s, staggered children)
- Cards animate in with a slight scale-up (`scale: 0.95` → `scale: 1`)
- Page transitions: fade in on load

**Hover Interactions:**
- All cards: `transform: translateY(-6px)` + subtle `box-shadow` increase on hover (smooth 0.2s transition)
- All primary buttons: slight scale-up (`scale: 1.04`) + background brightens on hover
- Nav links: animated underline that slides in from left on hover
- Logo: gentle wobble animation on hover (`@keyframes wobble`)

**Delight Animations (section-specific):**
- Hero section: floating soft shapes in background (yellow circles, teal blobs) with slow `@keyframes float` animation (up-down, infinite, slow)
- How It Works steps: numbered circles do a gentle `@keyframes bounce` when scrolled into view
- Stat counters (if used): count-up animation from 0 to value
- CTA buttons: a subtle shimmer/shine sweep effect on the primary yellow button (`@keyframes shimmer`)
- Testimonial carousel: smooth slide transitions, not jarring snaps
- Age group cards: a small sticker/badge element rotates slightly on hover

**Keep animations subtle and performance-friendly:**
- Use `will-change: transform` only where needed
- Prefer CSS transitions over JS where possible
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query (disable animations if user has set this)

```

**Part B — Homepage (~2–3 days)**

Build `app/(public)/page.tsx`. All content is static for now. Sections in order:

**1. Navbar**
- Sticky, scroll-aware: at top → transparent with white text/logo; after 60px scroll → white background with shadow
- Left: Go Kids logo (`thumbnail.png`, 120px wide, `next/image`, `priority`)
- Center (desktop): nav links — Assessments · Workshops · Mentor · Talk · About · Contact
- Right: "Login" (ghost button) + "Get Started" (primary yellow button, black text, rounded-full)
- Mobile: hamburger → ShadCN Sheet drawer with full nav links + both buttons
- Nav link hover: animated yellow underline slides in from left (CSS `::after` pseudo-element, `transform: scaleX(0→1)`)
- Logo hover: gentle `@keyframes wobble` (slight left-right rotation, 3 keyframes)

**2. Hero Section**
- Two-column layout (desktop): Left = text content, Right = `hero.jpg` with rounded-2xl, slight drop shadow, `priority` loading
- Left content:
  - Small tag above headline: yellow pill badge → "🌟 India's Future Readiness Platform"
  - Headline (Nunito 800, 56px desktop / 36px mobile): *"Prepare Your Child for the Future, Today"*
  - Subheadline (Inter, grey-text): "Assessments, workshops, mentorship, and expert talks — everything your child needs to discover their strengths and thrive."
  - Two CTA buttons: "Start Free Assessment" (primary yellow, black text, large, rounded-full) + "Explore Workshops" (white with black border, rounded-full)
  - Trust row below buttons: 3 small stats — "500+ Kids Assessed · 50+ Workshops · 30+ Expert Mentors" with a dot separator
- Background: soft off-white (`#FAFAF8`) with 3–4 large blurred floating shapes in the background (yellow circle, teal blob, coral blob) using `@keyframes float` (translateY -15px to 15px, 4s infinite alternate, each shape offset timing)
- Mobile: stack vertically, image on top (shorter, 250px height), text below
- Entry animation: headline fades up (Framer Motion `initial={{ opacity:0, y:30 }}` → `animate={{ opacity:1, y:0 }}`), staggered with subheadline and buttons (0.15s stagger)

**3. Four Vertical Cards**
- Section header: "Everything Your Child Needs" (Nunito 700, centred)
- 2×2 grid (desktop), 1 column (mobile)
- Each card: white background, rounded-2xl, border `1px solid #F3F4F6`, generous padding, hover `translateY(-6px)` + shadow
- Card structure: coloured icon background circle (teal/coral/sky/yellow) + Lucide icon (white), title (Nunito 700), description (Inter), "Learn more →" link in brand colour
  - **Assessments** (teal icon bg): "Discover your child's strengths, learning style, and career aptitude through guided psychometric assessments."
  - **Workshops** (coral icon bg): "Skill-building sessions on communication, leadership, creativity, and future-ready careers — live and self-paced."
  - **Mentor** (sky icon bg): "One-on-one sessions with expert educators, psychologists, and career coaches, matched to your child's needs."
  - **Talk** (yellow icon bg): "Expert webinars, panel discussions, and recorded sessions for parents and kids navigating growth and change."
- Section scroll animation: cards stagger in with Framer Motion `useInView` (each card delays by 0.1s × index)

**4. How It Works**
- Section background: `#FAFAF8`
- Centred section header: "How Go Kids Works"
- Three steps in a horizontal row (desktop) / vertical stack (mobile), connected by a dashed yellow line (desktop only, CSS)
- Each step: large numbered circle (yellow background, black number, Nunito 800, 48px) + step title + description
  - Step 1: "Create Your Child's Profile" — "Tell us about your child's interests, strengths, and goals."
  - Step 2: "Discover & Explore" — "Take an assessment, join a workshop, or book a mentor session."
  - Step 3: "Grow & Thrive" — "Get a personalised report, track progress, and unlock your child's potential."
- Number circles: Framer Motion `whileInView` bounce animation (`scale: 0→1.2→1`, spring)

**5. Programs by Age Group**
- Section header: "Programs for Every Age"
- Three cards side by side (desktop) / stacked (mobile):
  - **Ages 4–7 — Early Explorers** → use `programs-3.jpg` (Indian girl with book, cheerful green background). Programs: Creative Arts, Storytelling, Early STEM Play, Social Skills
  - **Ages 8–12 — Young Achievers** → use `programs-1.jpg` (boy building robot with goggles). Programs: Robotics & Coding, Communication Skills, Career Exploration, Leadership Basics

- Card design: image fills top half (rounded-t-2xl), content below, age badge (yellow pill, top-left overlay on image), card border, hover lift animation
- Programme tags: small rounded chips in teal/coral/sky

**6. Workshops Banner**
- Full-width section using `workshops-banner.jpg` as background image (children drawing at table, teal classroom)
- Dark overlay (`rgba(0,0,0,0.45)`) over image for text readability
- Centred content: headline "Explore Our Workshops", subline, two buttons: "Browse All Workshops" (yellow) + "View Schedule" (white outline)
- Parallax scroll effect on the background image (CSS `background-attachment: fixed` or Framer Motion scroll)

**7. Testimonials**
- Section background: white
- Section header: "What Parents & Kids Say"
- Horizontal carousel using Embla Carousel (auto-scroll, 3.5s interval, loop)
- 5 static testimonial cards: avatar (initials in coloured circle), name, role (Parent of / Student, Age X), star rating (5 yellow stars), quote text
- Card design: white, rounded-2xl, subtle shadow, yellow left border accent (4px)
- Navigation dots below carousel

**8. Final CTA Strip**
- Background: primary yellow `#F5C518`
- Headline (Nunito 800, black): "Ready to Unlock Your Child's Potential?"

- Background decoration: subtle repeating star/circle pattern (SVG, low opacity, white)

**9. Footer**
- Background: `#1A1A1A` (brand black)
- Top row: Go Kids logo (white/yellow version — CSS filter or a dedicated white logo variant) + tagline
- 4 link columns (white text, yellow hover): Platform (Assessments, Workshops, Mentor, Talk), Company (About, Contact, Careers), Legal (Privacy Policy, Terms), Connect (Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn links)
- Bottom bar: copyright text, "Made with ❤️ in India"

**Part C — Basic Auth (~1–2 days)**

- `POST /api/auth/register` — name, email, phone, password → bcrypt hash → create user (role=parent, isEmailVerified=false) → generate 6-digit OTP → save hashed OTP to otpTokens (15-min expiry) → send OTP email via Nodemailer
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` — validate OTP → mark user verified → delete token
- `POST /api/auth/resend-otp` — regenerate + resend
- NextAuth.js v5 credentials provider — returns session with id, name, email, role
- `middleware.ts` — protects `/parent/*`, `/instructor/*`, `/mentor/*`, `/admin/*`, `/superadmin/*`; redirects unauthenticated to `/login`; redirects by role on successful login
- Register page: name, email, phone, password — React Hook Form + Zod, yellow primary button, Nunito headings, matching brand style
- OTP verify page: 6-digit split input (one box per digit), 60s resend countdown timer, animated checkmark on success
- Login page: email + password, "Forgot password?" link, yellow CTA button
- All auth pages: centered card layout, Go Kids logo at top, bright white background — **no dark mode, no grey backgrounds**
- On login success: redirect parent → `/parent/dashboard` (placeholder "Welcome, [name]" page)

## Notes for AI Code Agents

Each week's prompt is self-contained but agents must always be provided:
1. **Tech Stack** section
2. **Brand Identity & Design System** section (colours, fonts, images, animations) — **READ THIS EVERY TIME**
3. **MongoDB Schema** section
4. **Role System** table
5. That week's **"AI Agent Prompt Focus"** block
6. Model definitions from prior weeks that the current week depends on

**Non-negotiable conventions across all agents:**
- `app/api/[resource]/route.ts` for all API routes
- Mongoose for all DB — never raw MongoDB driver
- ShadCN components as base primitives
- React Hook Form + Zod for all forms
- `getServerSession(authOptions)` for all protected routes
- TypeScript strict mode
- API responses: `{ success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }`
- Brand colours: yellow `#F5C518`, black `#1A1A1A`, teal `#2BBCB0`, coral `#F4845F`, sky `#4FC3F7`
- **NO dark mode. NO dark backgrounds. Light, bright, and child-friendly always.**
- Framer Motion for scroll animations, hover states, and page transitions
- All images via `next/image`, logo from `/public/images/thumbnail.png`
